## Installation ##
Clone this repo, run `npm install`.

## Usage ##

Run `npm start`. This should both run the local server and launch your browser.

If your browser fails to launch, or shows a 404 error, navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080.

Go inside the backend folder and run `node server` or `nodemon server` to run up the API server.

Use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the local servers.
